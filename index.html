 <h2 align="center">STAR-WHO?</h2>
 <p><em>Star-Lord (Peter Quill) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Steve Englehart and Steve Gan, the character first appeared in Marvel Preview #4 (Jan. 1976). The son of a human named Meredith Quill and the Spartoi J'son, Quill assumes the mantle of Star-Lord, an interplanetary policeman.
   
   The character played a role in the crossover comic book storylines "Annihilation" (2006) and "Annihilation: Conquest" (2007), and became the leader of the space-based superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy in the 2008 relaunch of the comic of the same name. He has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including animated television series, toys, and trading cards. Chris Pratt portrays the character in the 2014 live-action film Guardians of the Galaxy, and will reprise the role in the upcoming films Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Avengers: Infinity War.</em></p>

 <p><em>Chris Pratt portrays Peter Quill / Star-Lord in the Marvel Studios film Guardians of the Galaxy. Peter Quill is a young boy who, unable to accept his mother's death due to cancer, leaves the hospital in tears, and is subsequently abducted by an extraterrestrial star-ship.  Throughout the movie, Peter is shown regularly listening to a cassette tape given to him by his mother (serving as his only connection with Earth), containing various hit songs released between 1967 and 1979. The film had a major effect on Quill's appearances in other media as his design in the comics, video games, and cartoons was changed to reflect Pratt's look in the movie.</em></p>

<section id="why">
 <h2 align="center" > Why I like it?</h2>
 <p> It´s just simple, Star-Lord is a fabulous hero, he can do anything if he wants, also he is the leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy! And don´t forget that he in the movies is a GOD, that´s because he is the son of Ego, a living planet that is a kind of celestial person that has powerful powers;besides that he can motivate all his companions, he simply never turns his back on a friend, just as he is a great leader for the guardians; Let's not forget Chris Pratt (actor who plays him) who is a great actor who knows how to play Star Lord in both films, he is a charismatic person, kind and very funny, the role is perfect for him, and think that The whole team of Galaxy Guardians will face hand in hand against the Avengers, so THIS WOULD BE EPIC! </p>
